# Recap

The meeting went decently this week. We did get to perform our ice breaker but
with little positive reaction. From what I've seen the members of our club seem
to want to focus more on the hardcore coding in comparison to social aspects of
the club. Many people did show up (around 10) and finished most of the
Twilio/Remote Control project but several problems did arise.

The first being lack of communication among the younger members. Our freshman
members seem reluctant and even unwilling to talk to their fellow peers, whereas
the Junior/Senior members seem fine with socializing with one another. This
should simply be natural freshman shyness and should wear off over time.

The second being the lack of understanding from some of our less-experienced
members. From what I've seen and from what some have even straight-forwardly
told me is that they don't enjoy the lesson because all they did was copy and
paste code into JS Bin. One freshman persisted to tell me that he was starting to
lose his ability to find the fun in this.

Getting the freshman to open up should become easier as we become closer to them
as time moves forward, and hopefully I will find a better game to open the crowd
up. The second problem should be harder to deal with as it is more lesson plan
than actual club planning and strategy.
