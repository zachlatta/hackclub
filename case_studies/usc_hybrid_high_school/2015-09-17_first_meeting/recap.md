# Recap

![Hack!](http://imgur.com/fw3etSe)

This is our first _actual_ meeting. The one previously held was styled into more
of an information session, where students (potential hackers!) could get a quick
taste of the club before officially deciding to join. This meeting held students
who were officially committed to our Hack Club. We had 15 hackers show up
(expecting a few more over the next 2-3 meetings). Overall, went swell! Hackers
left seeming to be excited to return next week.

- **Greeting (_5 min_):** As hackers came in, they were excitedly greeted, in an
  attempt to make the meeting as high energy as possible. They were also all
  asked to say their names to begin familiarization.
- **Intro to hackEDU & Growth Mindset (_10 min_):** Gave a more concise version
  of
  [this](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/master/cohort_4/playbook/ACTIVITIES.md#introduction-talk)
  (excluding Hack Camp specific information). There was a heavy emphasis on
  growth mindset, code of conduct, and what makes hackEDU different from last
  year's coding club.
- **Intro to HTML/CSS/JavaScript (_10 min_):** Quick intro to what
  HTML/CSS/JavaScript can do. Done by following the “Running It” section for
  “Portfolio”
  [here](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/master/cohort_4/playbook/ACTIVITIES.md#introduction-talk).
- **Starting the Portfolio Workshop (_30 min_):** Hackers began doing the
  [Portfolio Workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio).
  This mainly consisted of hackers setting up theirdeveloper environment, and
  facilitators going around to help hackers set up accounts and the like. About
  75% of hackers had their dev environments complete and had started the rest of
  the workshop by the end of the 30 minutes.
- **Clean-Up/Dismissal (_5 min_):** Hackers closed out of their Chromebooks and
  put them away. While some left to catch the bus, about 60% of the hackers
  stayed to see some examples of source code.

# Problems

- **Sharing Space** A math class/tutoring session was sharing the room with us
  at the same time. It was rather distracting. Actionable: email owner of room
  to reserve the room solely for us.

# Additional Notes

- **Female Leaders == Increased # of Girl Hackers:** Considering that our Hack
  Club is run through our STEAM Club, those who join (STEAM) are given the
  option of joining different groups within the overarching club (engineering,
  art, physics, coding, etc.). Every single girl that joined STEAM joined our
  Hack Club. When I asked them why, they said it was due to the fact that the
  person leading it was female, and that the other groups would feel more like a
  “boy's club.”
