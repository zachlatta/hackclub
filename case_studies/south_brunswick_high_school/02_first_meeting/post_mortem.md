# After Meeting on 10/29/15

## What Went Well?

The competition planning went very well because the members actually got into
smaller groups and discussed ideas for their project proposals. For example, one
member wanted to create an application like Google Maps but just for the school
so parents have an easier time getting around the school during events like
parent-teacher conferences.

## What Didn't Go Well?

Since many students forgot to bring in their laptops, we were not able to do the
landing page activity with them and instead did project euler problems with
them. This back-up activity could've gone better if we provided them with a
little easier questions that did not require code to solve. Next time, we will
give AMC/AIME questions. As a result, we told them to bring in their laptops
next time with Android Studio and a GitHub account so we could not only educate
them on how to create a simple app and share code but also get feedback about
club meetings on the labs website.
