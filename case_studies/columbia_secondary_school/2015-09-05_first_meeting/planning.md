# Planning

My team and I had a meeting for ourselves in order to talk about all the details
of what we hope to do for the club. We had a few interested prospective students
sit in for input.

## Highlights

- To have a Skype option for members of the club so that people who want to
  attend the club but have to be home.
- To start the classes with instruction, then when students feel more
  comfortable with the work, they can have more individual projects
- To try to get the class to go on a field trip to a hackathon.
- We can have a starting set of things we want the students to learn
  (JavaScript, HTML/CSS) and expand depending on their interests.
