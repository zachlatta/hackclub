# Fourth Meeting

## What Happened

- Our adviser could not come to the lab so we needed to stay in a regular room
  with no computers.
- We briefly went through the presentation.
  - Talked about HackingEDU and Challenge.
- We then improvised, by teaching IF/ELSE statements using Java.
  - We made sure everyone was able to understand.

## Problems we faced

- We weren't prepared when not having the computer lab.
- Seemed boring

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We improvised and taught IF/ELSE statements using Java, we made sure that the
  hackers were aware about the "extra" stuff that Java uses that JavaScript
  doesn't.
- We also tried to have the hackers participate.
- We won't have a lab this Wednesday either, so instead we will have a fun
  activity involving for loops.

## Tips

- Have a backup plan that you can always use. Maybe update every workshop.
