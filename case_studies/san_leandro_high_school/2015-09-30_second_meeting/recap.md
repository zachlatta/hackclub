# Recap

1. Let's just say this meeting started off as a disaster, our adviser is out,
   and there is a substitute teacher, as you many know sub like to leave as soon
   as possible.
2. Our entire club had to wait outside in the sun while some members and I run
   around school seeing if any teacher willing to give up their lab for 2 hours.
3. To my relief, we found the business academy teacher willing to give her lab
   to us for today. Our original plan for today was to have a lecture on the
   basics of programming, however due to us not having access to the projectors,
   our plan changed to doing the
   [portfolio workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio).
4. While doing the workshop I notice that:
  - Some are on Codecademy or CodeHS, which is totally fine as they are allowed
    to get off track if they want.
    - Most that are working on Codecademy are helping each other out, however,
      sometimes I have to jump in to help.
    - When CodeHS people get stuck I will usually try to explain the problem to
      them in my own words.
  - Some are asking for DDoS-ing tools or tips
    - I will usually respond to them that DDoS-ing is illegal, and that is not
      what this club is about.
      - One idea that we can do in the future is to set up a Raspberry Pi to
        DDoS another Raspberry Pi.
    - People will usually help their friends that are sitting around them Maybe
      we can get encourage the entire club to work together by having group
      project instead, for example
      [neverforgetsam2k15.lol](http://neverforgetsam2k15.lol).
  - Overall I would say that we need to find better team building activity to
    get the entire club engaged, something like
    [neverforgetsam2k15.lol](http://neverforgetsam2k15.lol).
5. As always we ended the Meeting with a
   [hack cheer](https://youtu.be/ds3w27_6i98).

## What Didn't Go Well

- We don't have a backup plan if the original class room is not accessible.

## What Went Well

- Most of the members are willing to cooperate, which makes it easy for me to
  work short handed easily.

## Tips for Other Organizers

- **Important**Have a backup plan when the original meeting location is
  unavailable.
