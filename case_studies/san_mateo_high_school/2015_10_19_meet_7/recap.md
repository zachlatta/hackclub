- Talked about Project week, talked very briefly about Demo Week.
- Talked about HackingEDU.
- Hackers started programming.

## Problems we faced

- Not much, we didn't have as many people show up.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We just let the hackers work and helped if they needed it.

## Tips

- We could have gone around more, I recommend doing so as it connects you
  furthermore with the hackers.
- Make sure you clarify they can build anything they want.
