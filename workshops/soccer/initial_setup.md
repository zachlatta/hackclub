# Step 1: Understanding the Initial Setup

In this tutorial, you will be writing JavaScript code and using the p5.js and
p5.play.js library. You can learn more about them by Googling for `JavaScript`,
`p5.js` and `p5.play.js` respectively.

## Setup

- [ ] First off, make sure you've followed the
      [setup directions](README.md#setup) to create your working bin on the
      previous page.
- [ ] Make sure two tabs open, one for your working bin, and one for these
      workshop directions.

## Understanding the Code in the Working Bin

The the code for the working bin has 2 parts:

1. The HTML
2. The JavaScript

### HTML

The HTML adds the p5.js and p5.play.js libraries. Learn more about what the HTML
does [here](own_editor.md).

We won't really talk about the HTML that much in this tutorial. Our primary
focus will be the JavaScript code.

# Understanding the JavaScript

```js
function setup() {                           ┐
  createCanvas(300, 500);                    ├ setup function
}                                            ┘

function draw() {                            ┐
  background(255, 240, 220);                 ├ draw function
  drawSprites();                             │
}                                            ┘
```

- Everything inside `setup` function is only run once.
- Everything inside the `draw` function is run over and over again _forever_!

Don't worry about this too much now, we'll touch on this more later.

## Overview

For the rest of this section, we're going to understand the following lines of
code:

  - `createCanvas(300, 500);`
  - `background(255, 240, 220);`
  - `drawSprites();`

## Understanding `createCanvas`

Let's understand what this code does:

```js
createCanvas(300, 500);
```

### Understanding through Tinkering

- [ ] _In your working bin, try changing some of the values of `createCanvas` to
      understand what the values affect. Below is an example of how I play
      around with the values of `createCanvas` to try understand what it does:_

### Explanation

As a reminder, the area on which everything lives is called the **canvas**:

> ![](img/r_vocab_2.png)

`createCanvas` creates and sets the size of the canvas. Here is an example:

```
createCanvas(300, 500);
              ^    ^
              |    └ set the *height* of the canvas to 500
              |
              └ set the *width* of canvas to 300
```

Here is a diagram representing the result of the above code:

## Understanding `background`

### Understanding Through Tinkering

- [ ] _Try changing some of the values of `createCanvas` to see what it
      changes. Below is an example of how I play around with the values of
      `background` to try understand what it does:_

> ![](img/1_tinkering_background.gif)

### Explanation

```
This code sets the background color of the canvas:

  background(255, 255, 255);
              ^    ^    ^
              |    |    └ set how much *red* there is
              |    |
              |    └ set how much *green* there is
              |
              └ set how much *blue* there is
```

## Understanding `drawSprites`

Remember from the previous page that each of the interactive elements on the
page are called sprites.

> ![](img/r_vocab_1.png)

The code `drawSprites()` is responsible for drawing all of those sprites to the
page once they are created. But how do you create a sprite? You'll find out in
the next section!

## Computer Science Fundamentals ![](img/computer_science.png)

**_This Section is Coming Soon!_**—In the mean time, here is a sneak peek:

### Functions

`createCanvas` and `background` are what we call _**functions**_.

Functions can have the following:

- Inputs
- Side effects
- Outputs

#### Lemonade Analogy

Consider the lemonade making machine as a function:

![](img/function_machine.png)

In the above drawing, you can see that

- The inputs are a glass, lemon, and mint
- The output is lemonade

But what are the side effects?

- The lemonade juicing machine gets hot from use.
- You, the user, who is not an input, get better at learning how to make
  lemonade.
- You and your friends bond over making lemonade.

Sometimes, you care more about the side effects than the outputs.

#### `background`

Let's examine the components of `background(255, 255, 255)`

##### Inputs

The inputs are whatever in the parentheses.

In this case the `background` function has 3 inputs:

```
background(255, 255, 255);
            ^    ^    ^
            |    |    └ input 3
            |    |
            |    └ input 2
            |
            └ inputs 1
```

##### Side Effects

The side effect of this function is to set the color of the canvas.

##### Outputs

This function has no output. This may not seem like it makes sense right now,
but if you visit the functions section of `createSprite` (which doesn't exist
yet), it will make much more sense.
