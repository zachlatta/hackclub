# Recap

The meeting, overall, went great! In addition to our original 15 members, ~3
other hackers joined us today due to the Engineering section of STEAM Club being
canceled for the day; it's unclear as to whether or not they'll be permanently
with us, but it was a good way to spread the word within other students who are
interested in some sort of science but are unsure where to take it. We're
expecting a few more additions as students finish deciding what clubs they're
going to be a part of for the year.

- **Greeting (*5 min*):** As hackers came in, they were greeted and asked how
  their day was, while a leader helped in checking out Chromebooks.
- **Q&A (*15 min*):** As the majority of our hackers are beginners, they're not
  very familiar with code and what can be done with it. An overview was given
  before, but hackers were encouraged to go home and research more about the
  topic and come in with any questions they had. Several questions were asked,
  and leaders tried to answer them to the best or their ability.
  - *What does it take to make a game?*
  - *What languages do you have to know to make an app?*
  - *Where did you learn to code and what made you like it?*
- **Workshop (*35 min*):** Hackers continued to work on the
  [Portfolio workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio).
  Most had moved on from setting up their developer environments (c9 and GitHub)
  , but a few were finishing that up before moving on. Leaders assisted new
  arrivals on starting the workshop from the beginning. Overall, the hackers
  worked rather independently, without much interruption from the facilitators,
  except for questions and check-ins.
- **Clean-Up/Outside of Club Activities (*5 min*):** Hackers put away their
  Chromebooks and joined the rest of STEAM club to re-cap what everybody did
  today. Some of the hackers stayed a few extra minutes and exchanged League of
  Legends summoner names, as well as coordinated a game for that evening
  (squee!).

## Problems

- **Dying Chromebooks:** Due to the fact that the Chromebooks are being used
  right after having been used all day means that they're prone to dying rather
  quickly during a club meeting. Actionables on this are to both acquire extra
  sets of chargers and to attempt to reserve certain Chromebooks to be charged
  30 minutes before the club meets.

## Additional Notes

- **Music:** When most students open a Chromebook at Hybrid High, the first
  thing they do is put in their earphones and listen to music. Something that I
  found fascinating during the meeting was that only two hacker had earphones
  in, and after about ten minutes into the workshop, had taken them out in order
  to discuss with their peers.
