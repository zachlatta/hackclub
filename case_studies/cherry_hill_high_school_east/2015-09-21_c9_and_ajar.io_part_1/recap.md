> *Dear reader*, these recaps were initially requested by
> [hackEDU](https://hackclub.io/) for other club organizers to read. However if
> you're a club member you can use them to find out what happened at a meeting
> you couldn't attend, if you just want to review some content, or for any
> reason you want!

Another successful meeting for the Cherry Hill Computer Science Club! Had around
30 people attend, with 3 or 4 new members, even though there were no "late
buses" (second round of buses at 4pm). Our meeting last 1.5 hours.

The club officers met during the weekend to talk about the club and create
content. We made:

- [Google Slide presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12EV5p5hZW1vRDzhjUGbSsconuaTV2mTil9-1FlEoPn8)
  - Feel free to make a copy and customize!

- [Intro to Cloud9 workshop](https://github.com/CHE-CS/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops/cloud9)
  - Also introduces how to use import CSS and JavaScript files into HTML
  (`<link>` and `<script>` elements).

- [Ajar.io Part 1 workshop](https://github.com/CHE-CS/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops/ajar)
  - Huge success. Introduces `<canvas>` element and finishes with having a dot
  drawn on screen.

## CHE Hacks

Introduced our members (again) to a hackathon we're organizing at our city's
public library. Feel free to register at http://chehacks.com.

## Cloud9 Intro

![c9.io](img/c9.png)

We decided it was time to transition away from JS Bin because

1. It was being randomly blocked by Barracuda Networks (our school's firewall).
2. We think it's time to expand our member's understanding web development
   (setting up and linking the files yourself).

See the workshop
[here](https://github.com/CHE-CS/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops/cloud9).
Feel free to add to it, I will add a troubleshooting section there instead of
hiding it in this recap.

The workshop took around 40 minutes to complete, slightly longer than I had
hoped. Yet it was *ok*. If people finish early (some did), encourage them to add
their own styles to the button or to change the alert text. Possibly point them
to the [list of CSS colors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp).

## Ajar.io Part 1

![A jar!](img/jar.png)

Ajar.io is a series of workshops (developed by @bogidon, @Salamander1012, and
@Jonwlee) to teach students how to make a clone of the online game
[agar.io](http://agar.io).

This workshop was thought up because many people in our club were playing
agar.io (instead of following the lesson). Ajar drew a lot of interest – in
fact for much of the workshop *everyone in the room was on task*. Success!

> "The idea of having us make agar.io is genius and I'm exited to go further."
> - A delighted participant

> "this club is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AMAZING." – an enthralled member

> "It is Agar.io!!!!!!!!!!!" – a psyched student's response to the question
> "What is one thing we did well?"

### Suggestions

If people finish early engage them with more content!

- Point them to
  [W3C's page on the `<canvas>` API](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp)
  (this like appears three times by the end of Part 1 of the workshop).

- Explain the `context.arc()` function. The parameters are `x`, `y`, `radius`,
  `startAngle`, and `endAngle`. Focus on explaining the angles, which are in
  radians (the `x`, `y`, and `radius` are easy to understand). Explain that the
  `arc` function forms a circle when the `endAngle` is 2π radians (360º). Let
  them predict what would happen if the `endAngle` is set to π instead of 2π.

- One club member wanted to draw a diamond. I walked her through googling `"How
  to draw a diamond on canvas with JavaScript"`. It led us to
  [this tutorial](http://www.onlywebpro.com/2011/07/02/html5-canvas-for-absolute-beginners-part-2/).
  Careful with this particular tutorial because
  1. the JavaScript lives in the HTML as opposed to a separate file like in the
     tutorial
  2. `context` is abbreviated to `ctx`
  3. there is a function called `drawShape()`

## Personal notes about teaching

- I'm getting more comfortable teaching: speaking louder, explaining more
  clearly.
- Better at getting people's attention (turning lights on and off, speaking
  louder, getting VPs to help gather people's attention).
- Fewer distractions, more focused on answering questions. I was constantly
  circling the room.
