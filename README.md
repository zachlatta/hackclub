Hack Club is the worldwide movement of student-led coding clubs.

Hack Clubs are after-school communities at high schools where people build things together. This repository contains the tools for starting and leading great clubs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

If you need any help, please contact us at team@hackclub.com or on our [Slack](SLACK.md).

1. Check out our [public issues board][0]. If your issue isn't on the board, [open a new one][1].
2. Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. First time contributors should look for the "[first-timers-only][2]" label on issues.
3. Fork the project ([Need help forking a project?][3]). You'll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work on that branch ([Need help with branching?][4]).
5. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xxx-feature` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
6. Your changes should follow our [styleguides][5].
7. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Hack Club's `master` branch. We'll do a quick review and give you feedback.
