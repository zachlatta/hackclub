# Case Studies

_**Deprecated:** On 11.17.15 we decided to deprecate case studies. While they'll
no longer be required for Labs clubs each week, anyone interested is welcome to
still submit them :-)._

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains case studies of events from
[Labs](https://github.com/hackclub/meta/blob/master/labs/README.md) clubs and
any other clubs that choose to participate.

A case study is written for each of a club's events. Each case study is a story
that paints a up-close, in-depth, and context-rich picture of all the planning
and the aftermath of a given event.

We want to document any and every event related to a club, including things
like:

- The club fair
- The first club meeting
- Club elections
- Club planning meetings
- Any field trip that a club might organize

We break case studies into two parts:

1. The plan for the event
2. A recap of the event

## Directory Structure

There is a directory for each club.

Here is what the directory structure looks like:

```
.
├── club_1
|   ├── 2015-09-12_club_fair
|   |   ├── planning.md
|   |   └── recap.md
|   ├── 2015-09-19_first_meeting
|   |   ├── planning.md
|   |   └── recap.md
├── club_2
|...
```

Each club's directory contains sub-directories for each of the club's events
(e.g. club fair, first club meeting, etc.)

Each event directory contains two files: [a planning
document](#planning-document) and [a recap document](#recap-document).

## Planning Document

The planning document, named `planning.md`, contains three things:

- An outline of what's going to happen at the event
- A list of problems that you anticipate you might run into and how you might
  solve them
- Any other associated planning done to make that event great.

## Recap Document

The recap document, named `recap.md`, contains a reflection of each meeting.
Each recap should answer the following questions:

- What you end up doing during the event and how did it differ from the
  original expectations?
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What tips do you have for other organizers?
  - _For example:_
    - Would you recommend doing or not doing what you did activity?
    - If you would recommend it, what might they watch out for?
