# Basic Git and GitHub

## Tips and Tricks While Using This Workshop

1. To see a GIF in another tab, right click on the GIF and click _open in new
   tab_.
2. **Don't include** the **square brackets** mentioned (`[text-here]`) when
   typing.
  - Those are indicators of areas where you type custom text.
  - `5. Type: git branch [branch-name]` would be: `git branch custom-text`.
3. After you type a command in the terminal, hit **"enter"** on your
   **keyboard** to complete the command.

## Preparing Your Workspace

_Note: If you already have a pre-existing workspace you can skip to the
[next section](#what-is-git)._

Git requires at least **one** file in your workspace to be used. The steps below
will take you through setting the workspace up.

1. Login to your Cloud9 homepage - https://c9.io/
  - Register if you haven't already.
    - We recommend signing up with your GitHub account - https://github.com/.
  - It should look like this:

     ![Cloud9 dashboard](img/cloud9_dashboard.png)

2. Create a workspace!
  - Press the **create a new workspace** button.

    ![create new workspace](img/create_new_workspace.gif)

  - Give the workspace a good name that conveys what the workspace is used for
    quickly, and concisely.
    - There are no spaces allowed in the name, use a dash (`-`) for spaces if
      you need them.
  - Add a short description, you'll thank yourself later!
  - Select public for the privacy settings, it'll make it easier for people to
    help you with your project.
  - If you already have a GitHub project with files and you want to have it
    ready when you create the workspace you can add its link in the box
    provided.
  - For the template you may choose either **Custom** or **HTML5**.

    ![name new workshop](img/name_new_workshop.gif)

3. Get rid of the unnecessary junk.
  - On the left sidebar: Right click on README.md and hello-world.html.
    - Select **"Delete"** and **Yes** to any warnings.
      - You won't need these for your project.
  - Close the opened README.md as well.

    ![close readme](img/close_readme.gif)

4. Create an `index.html` file.
  - On the left sidebar: Right click and press **"New File"**.
  - Name the file `index.html`.
  - Double-click and open it.
5. Write your name in the `index.html` file.
  - If you don't know how, you may use this pre-provided code:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head></head>
      <body>
          <p>Your name here</p>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

6. Save the `index.html` file.
  - Make sure the active file is the `index.html` file by either clicking on it
    on the sidebar or clicking anywhere in the code.
  - You may press Ctrl+S (Windows), Command+S (Mac) or go to File --> Save.

    ![save in Cloud9](img/save_in_cloud9.gif)

7. Celebrate!

   Your workspace is now ready to be used with Git!

## What is Git?

**Git is a version control system** - https://git-scm.com/

- Tracks and manages changes to your code.

  ![Git status](img/git_status.png)

- Git has tools to show that it has **detected** a **change** in the **file**.
  - Changes consist of anything you've added or removed from the file.
- Git allows you to save the same files at different points in time.
  - This allows us to look at our code's history from start to finish.
    - If we make a mistake and it seems irreversible, just select a version of
      the file from back in time.

**Example: If We Used Git With Word Documents**

- You are using Word and have a file named `mystory.docx`.
  - You write for 5 hours and save each hour.
    - Each time you save, this overwrites your copy.
- With Git, it would instead create another version of the file in that point of
  time.
  - Git hides these other versions so your folder doesn't get messy, but you can
    call on the others if need be.

- Git treats every version of code as a **"snapshot"** that you can look **back/
  revert** to at anytime.
  - Running a command called `git log` in the terminal displays every change
    you've saved:

    ![Git log](img/git_log.png)

## Git's Tools

### Repository

_(short-form: "repo")_

A repository is a place where your project files are stored.

- Sort of like a main **folder**

### Branch

- It's like a folder inside of your **repo**.
  - Where your files are stored.
- You use branches for teams collaboration.
  - Two people don't work on the same file at the same time.
    - Each person has their own version of the code.
- Their own copy of the files is called a **fork** or **"forking a repo"**.
- Must be named without spaces -- **replace a space with a dash (-)**.

![example branches](img/example_branches.png)

**Example: Why Branches?**

_Bob & John are working on one repo and the same files at the same time:_

- Bob encounters a bug, it will take about an hour to fix.
- John wants to continue working, but Bob's bug is not allowing him to continue.
  - In this situation, John would have to wait for Bob to fix the bug, then
    continue his own work.
- An better alternative: Create two different versions of the same folder and
  its files of code (different branches).
  - Work on their own work and bring them together when they are done.

**Example: Branch Merging**

- Bob is working on the main.css file for the tool bar.
- John is also working on the main.css file, but for the header.
- We don't want them overlapping each other's code!
  - Make changes to their own **branches** and then **merge** after to bring
    both of their changes together.
  - Git has tools that allows you merge changes even if they occupy the same
    file and lines.

### Master Branch

- The main **branch**
  - Git creates this **branch** automatically for you.
    - This is only for completed versions of the code.
- Where coders (you!) **merge** their final changes.
  - Bob and John would merge their changes in the **master branch**.

**Diagram of Master Branch Versus Another Branch**

![feature branch tree](img/feature_branch_tree.png)

- Think of "master" as the tree trunk and "feature" as a literal branch.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub (https://github.com/) is an online **Git repository hosting service**.

- A friendly way to look at and manage **repositories** and **branches with** a
  GUI (graphical user interface).
  - Basically prettier than just text on the terminal.
- Has its own tools that makes it easier and faster to collaborate with others
  (we'll go into that later!).

## Git and GitHub Pages w/ Provided Link

**GitHub Pages is a free service by GitHub** that allows you to host a website
on their servers (https://pages.github.com/).

- The URL will have to be [username].github.io/[reponame]

### Preparations

1. You **need** to have at least one **file named `index.html`**.
  - This is the conventional name of the main HTML file and GitHub Pages
    **won't host your files without one**
2. You **provided** a **Git link** when you **made the workspace**:

  ![clone from git into Cloud9](img/clone_from_git_in_cloud9.png)

  Nah, not familiar? Follow the steps in
  **[Git and GitHub Pages w/ provided link](#git-and-gh-pages-w-provided-link) in
  heading below**

### Using Git and GitHub

1. Open your terminal
  - Depending on the workspace configuration you set, it might already be
    opened.
  - Hit the "+" button in the bottom panel area OR on the top-bar click
    "Window" and "New Terminal".

    ![open new terminal](img/new_terminal.gif)

2. Type the command: `git add [file]` OR `git add .`.
  - Adds a file to be tracked by git.
    - E.g. `git add index.html`.
  - My only file is `index.html`.
    - In the case you have **more than one file**, the **period [.] means add
      every file** in the workspace to the tracked files.
      - E.g. `git add .`

    ![git add .](img/git_add.gif)

3. Type: `git commit -m "[commit message here]"`.
  - Commits changes to be pushed to the branch.
    - `-m` stands for message and in quotations put a message that descriptions
      what you did.
      - If it is the first commit, simply put `git commit -m "first commit"`.
  - Think of committing as packaging something into a package and putting the
    shipping label on it.
  - Don't make bad commit messages: be concise, but clear about what you did.
    - [Bad message example](img/bad_commit_message.png)
    - [Good message example](img/good_commit_message.png)

    ![git commit](img/git_commit.gif)

4. Type: `git push`.
  - Part two of saving, **"pushing"**.
    - Uploading to GitHub.
  - Think of pushing as actually shipping the container to the recipient, which
    in this case is the repo.
  - After hitting enter, you need to sign with your **GitHub credentials**.
    - You can you find your username either on your profile or at these spots
      when you login to GitHub.

   ![GitHub username](img/github_username.png)

  - The characters for the password not show up in the terminal for security
   reasons -- just keep typing!

   ![git push password](img/git_push_password.gif)

5. Type: `git branch [branch-name]`.
  - Creates a branch.
  - We must name this [branch name] `gh-pages`.
    - GitHub will only host files in a branch named `gh-pages`.
  - **Example command: `git branch gh-pages`**.
  - Must be named without spaces -- **replace a space with a dash (-)**.
  - If you create a branch with the wrong name, delete it using:.
    - `git branch -d [name of branch]`.
6. Type: `git push gh-pages`.
  - Push your branch, `gh-pages`, online to GitHub.
  - Afterwards your website should be up at
    `https://[yourusername].github.io/[reponame]`.
  - It might take about 30 seconds to fully get online.

    ![git push to `gh-pages`](img/git_push_gh-pages.gif)

7. Go online to `https://[username].github.io/[reponame]`.
  - Your website is now online! Enter the URL using your credentials and it
    should show up (wait 30 seconds or more if it doesn't).
    - E.g. `https://nguyenbrian.github.io/example2`.
  - Note: The repo name is different from the branch name.
    - **The URL has is case sensitive - ensure the repo name is exactly the
      same one you put into your URL.**
  - **Example: `https://jevinsidhu.github.io/Personal-Website`**
8. Celebrate!

  Congrats, now you're a Git (6) God!

  ![Git (6) God](http://i.imgur.com/LWvdiqA.gif)

## Git and GitHub Pages w/o provided link

1. Open your terminal.
  - Depending on the workspace configuration you set, it might already be
    opened!
  - Hit the "+" button in the bottom panel area OR on the top-bar click
    "Window" (8th from the right) and "New Terminal".

    ![new terminal in Cloud9](img/new_terminal.gif)

2. In the terminal, type: `git init`.
  - This creates a .git file inside of your project folder.
  - The .git file stores all the location data for your workspace.
  - This allows you to use git inside your folder.

  ![git init](img/git_init.gif)

2. Type: `git remote add [remote-name] [link to repo]`.
  - Your changes need to connect your local folder to a remote one on GitHub.
    - You need a connection between the two --> Create a remote.
  - On GitHub, **click the green button that says "New Repository" near the
    middle-right area**.
    - Name your repo (e.g hello-world) and give a short description.
      - No spaces between your name --> replace a space with a dash (-).
      - Short and to the point description.
  - Click the green button that says "Create repository".
  - Copy the .git link it provides -- that's your `link to repo`.
  - It will be something similar looking to:
    https://github.com/nguyenbrian/example.git

    ![create a repo on GitHub](img/github_create_repo.gif)

  - **Example: Remote is a TV Remote Controller**.
    - Hand is your local copy.
    - **TV** is the **remote repo on GitHub**.
    - The **remote** is the **controller**.

    If you want to change the channel, you hit one channel up on the
    **controller (remote)** with your **hand (local)** and it **changes** the
    channel one upon your **TV (remote repo)**.

  - Open your terminal on **Cloud 9** and type the command:
    - `git remote add [remote-name] [link to repo]`
  - [remote-name] is where you name your remote.
    - **Don't include the square brackets** when you type, this is custom text
      you are inserting.
    - Name it something clear.
      - i.e. `github`
    - **[link to repo]** is where you paste the link from earlier.
      - Again, don't include the square brackets.
    - **Example command**: `git remote add github
      https://github.com/nguyenbrian/example.git`.

    ![git remote add](img/git_remote_add.gif)

3. Type: `git add [filename.extension]` OR `git add .`.
  - Adds a file to be tracked by git.
    - E.g. `git add index.html`.
  - My only file is `index.html`.
    - In the case you have **more than one**, the **period [.] means add every
      file** in the workspace to the tracked files.
      - E.g. `git add .`.

    ![git add](img/git_add.gif)

3. Type: `git commit -m "[commit message here]"`.
  - Commits changes to be pushed to the branch.
    - `-m` stands for message and in quotations put a message that descriptions
      what you did.
      - If it is the first commit, simply put `git commit -m "first commit"`.
  - Think of committing as packaging something into a package and putting the
    shipping label on it.
  - Don't make bad commit messages: be concise, but clear about what you did.
    - [Bad message example](img/bad_commit_message.png)
    - [Good message example](img/good_commit_message.png)

    ![git commit](img/git_commit.gif)

4. Type: `git push`.
  - Part two of saving, **"pushing"**.
    - Uploading to GitHub.
  - Think of pushing as actually shipping the container to the recipient, which
    in this case is the repo.
- After hitting enter, you need to sign with your **GitHub credentials**.
  - You can you find your username either on your profile or at these spots when
   you login to GitHub.

   ![GitHub username](img/github_username.png)

  - The characters for the password not show up in the terminal for security
   reasons -- just keep typing!

   ![enter password git push](img/git_push_password.gif)

5. Type: `git branch [branch-name]`.
  - Creates a branch.
  - We must name this [branch name] `gh-pages`.
    - GitHub will only host files in a branch named `gh-pages`.
  - **Example command: `git branch gh-pages`**.
  - Must be named without spaces -- **replace a space with a dash (-)**.
  - If you create a branch with the wrong name, delete it using:.
    - `git branch -d [name of branch]`
6. Type: `git push gh-pages`.
  - Push your branch, `gh-pages`, online to GitHub.
  - Afterwards your website should be up at
    `[yourusername].github.io/[reponame]`.
  - It might take about 30 seconds to fully get online.

    ![git push to gh-pages](img/git_push_gh-pages.gif)

7. Go online to `https://[username].github.io/[reponame]`.
  - Your website is now online! Enter the URL using your credentials and it
    should show up (wait 30 seconds or more if it doesn't).
    - E.g. https://nguyenbrian.github.io/example2
  - Note: The repo name is different from the branch name.
    - **The URL has is case sensitive -- ensure the repo name is exactly the
      same one you put into your URL**.
  - **Example: https://jevinsidhu.github.io/Personal-Website**.
8. Celebrate!

  You successfully pushed your site online!

## More Commands

### Clone

`git clone [repo-url]`

Cloning a workable copy of a repo onto your local workspace is when you download
the repo onto a new computer.

![git clone](img/git_clone.png)

You'll find the **[repo-url]** when you click a into a repo on GitHub and look
for this:

![clone URL](img/clone_url.png)

### Merge

`git merge [branch-to-merge-changes-from]`

Merging combines the differences from another branch into the current branch
you're working in. For the time being, stay away from this and do a
[pull request](#pull-requests) using GitHub.

## Extended GitHub Knowledge

### Pull Requests

A pull request means to request changes to be "pulled" from one branch into
another. Pull requests are commonly used to merge feature branches into master
branches.

![create pull request](img/create_pull_request.gif)

A good Git workflow:

![good git workflow](img/good_git_workflow.png)

### GitHub Terminology

#### Fork

- Creates an identical repo under your name allowing you to edit its contents.

Similar to a clone, except instead of merging you would do a pull request to
merge your changes to the master repo.

![GitHub fork button](img/github_fork_button.png)

#### Pull Request

- Request to merge the contents of a branch or fork into a repo.
- Needs to be approved by the administrators of the repo you're trying to merge
  into.
- Pulls the data from your repo into the main repo.

#### Issue

- User-submitted bug tracker.
- Allows contributors to discuss the bugs.

![GitHub issues tab](img/github_issues_tab.png)

#### Contributor

Someone that contributes to the default branch through things such as commits,
pull requests and submitting issues.
