# Bootstrap

In this workshop, we're going to build a similar website to what we started in [Personal Website](../personal_website/README.md). We'll be introducing a tool called [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), which is a set of pre-written CSS that makes it super easy to build complex sites.

Hundreds of thousands of websites, including http://www.nba.com/, https://www.lyft.com/, and https://www.nasa.gov/, are built on Bootstrap. Check out https://expo.getbootstrap.com/ for more examples.

Let's get started.
