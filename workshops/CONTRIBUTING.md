## We Love Questions

Before we get started, if you ever have any questions about anything or just
want to talk through something, you can reach us almost 24/7 on our Slack.

To ask a question on our Slack:

1. Join our Slack: [https://slack.hackclub.io](https://slack.hackclub.io)
2. Then join the `#curriculum` channel: [https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/curriculum/](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/curriculum/)
3. Ask your question!

## How to Contribute to the Workshops

There are three ways to contribute:

1. [Create an Issue](#create-an-issue)
2. [Improve an existing workshop](#improve-an-existing-workshop)
3. [Create a new workshop](#create-a-new-workshop)

### Create an Issue

If you notice any problems or have an idea for a feature, create a GitHub issue
describing the improvement you want to see. Click
[here](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues/new) to create a new GitHub
issue.

### Improve an Existing Workshop

If you see an error in our workshops and want to do more than just create an
issue, you can submit a pull request to fix the issue. A walkthrough of how to
submit a pull request can be found [here](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Create a New Workshop

We also love contributions of new workshops! Make sure you've read through
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start though. We also
highly recommend getting the input of the rest of the community in the
[Slack](#we-love-questions).

Here are our instructions for making a workshop:

**Step 1: Creating the necessary files and folders:**

Before continuing, browse through the directory structure of some
workshops like [Portfolio](portfolio) and [Dodge](dodge).

1. Make sure that you've followed the directions in
   [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and cloned the `hackclub` repo.
2. Create a directory with the name of the workshop in the
   [`/workshops`](../workshops) directory. The name of your workshop should only
   be one or two words like `soccer` or `remote_control`.
3. Inside the directory you just created, create a `README.md` file.
   You will be writing your workshop in this Markdown file. Feel free to create
   other Markdown files that you link to from your newly `README.md` (see
  [Dodge](dodge) as an example of a workshop that does this.
4. In [`/workshops/README.md`](README.md), add your workshop to the
   [Community Workshops](README.md#community-workshops) table.

**Step 2: Create the workshop with the following requirements:**

- A learner can finish a workshop in 1 hour or less.
- By the end of the workshop, a learner will have finished building something
  that they can show their friends.
- Workshops are written in Markdown
- Workshops use GIFs to explain how to do things
- Workshops are written assuming that the learner will be following along in
  [Cloud9](https://c9.io), an online IDE. (We do this so that anyone with a web
  browser and an internet connection can use our curriculum)
- The workshop will have checkpoints in it that show working code examples
  inside of a [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com) examples. To create these JS Bins,
  use a tool we created, `jsbinctl`. Here is a link to
  [`jsbinctl`'s README](lib/jsbinctl/README.md)
