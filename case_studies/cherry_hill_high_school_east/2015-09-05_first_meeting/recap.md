# Recap

Meeting went pretty well! Estimated attendance was 20 and we had 34 show up. The
presentation used is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t9k9QYx7PpkTw9O18oeqniBzg_NpvvGOSFGVL-9tRxI/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
Step-by-step it went as follows:

- **Rock, paper, scissors**: people _really_ liked it. Great starter. I gave out
  a pair of zip-up Bloomberg earphones I got from PennApps X and a free iTunes
  song voucher I got from PennApps XII.

- **The presentation**: also a success. One of our VPs (Salman) added an
  explanation that "CS can help you in any career" right after the `What is CS?`
  slide.

- **The workshop**: we used
  [this workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/blob/playbook-portfolio/playbook/workshops/portfolio/README.md).
  I used it because I wanted to get people coding as soon as possible without
  the overhead of setting up C9. This was a good idea, but having gone the C9
  route we wouldn't have had problem #1 ==> There were two problems: 1) some
  circuit breaker got tripped and 15 computers powered off causing those people
  to loose their work. It's unfortunate because they didn't get to the part
  where they can save 2) our school firewall system supplied by _Barracuda
  Networks_ for some reason blocked https://jsbin.com through the middle of the
  workshop. Very annoying. We transitioned those affected to
  https://jsfiddle.net. Anyway, the workshop was very well received. Here are
  some excerpts from our feedback.
    - _Overall, the tutorial was extremely lucid, particularly in regards to
      describing all the necessary details for the code._
    - _Very easy to follow lessons._
    - _The tutorial was very interesting and informative_

- **Setting up C9**: we finished off with getting everyone set up with a C9 and
  GitHub account. We just let them clone
  [one of our club's repositories](https://github.com/CHE-CS/Personal-Websites).
  It actually took quite a while to get this set up (~20 minutes) primarily
  because it was impromptu so there were no slides made. We did the C9 set up
  because we'll be using it in the future.

## Problems

- **Distractions**: people were doing other things on their computers, primarily
  they were playing agar.io (like 5 of them). This problem was SOLVED by
  approaching those people and asking them if anything was wrong with the
  lecture that they resolved to playing games. Unexpectedly, the answer was yes.
  _They played games because they were stuck_. I helped them get unstuck and
  they got back on track. Lesson learned: approach people who aren't following
  the workshop, chances are they're having difficulties and are too shy to ask
  for help.
- **Losing work**: ugh, circuit tripped. JSFiddle might be better at this than
  JS Bin.. or do the GitHub account setup for JS Bin first so work is saved.
