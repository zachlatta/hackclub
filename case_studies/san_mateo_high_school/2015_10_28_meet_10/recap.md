# 10th Meeting

## What Happened

- We had a new adviser, as our main adviser couldn't be with us on Wednesdays,
  so we now have 2 advisers, one for Monday and the other for Wednesday.
- We started with the
  [presentation](https://github.com/SMHS-Programming/club/blob/ab41ed8a83b7e4feb04768692ac9397ce3d2f07e/meetings/9_28_Meeting_IV.pdf)
- Then we decided to have some fun since our adviser wasn't there, we talked
  about a website that was created in HackingEDU. We went into
  (http://www.getwiththe.club/). Then our adviser was coming into the room,
  so we stopped.
- We resumed with having the hackers work on their projects.

## Problems we faced

- No big ones, just going around and helping out.
- We needed to explain more about the club to the adviser.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We just explained what the club does and how we hope to impact the community.
- We helped out the people who wanted help.

## Tips

- It's nice to explain correctly and honestly what your club will be doing and
  what is the main objective of it.
