# 9th Meet

## What Happened

- Went through without slides (not ready :/). Used last week's workshop slide.
- Talked about HackingEDU, Swag collected and people I've met.
- We didn't have a full hackathon participant there so no one could talk.
- Talked about Los Altos Hacks.
- Prepared slides later for email/facebook:

## Problems we faced

- Not having slides to talk about HackingEDU was a little hard.
- We are still thinking about the feedback forms.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We managed and showed pictures from Facebook.
- Went to losaltoshacks.com and talked about that hackathon.

## Tips

- Be ready with slides.
- We went around more and definitely improved our ways of helping/interacting
  with the hackers.
