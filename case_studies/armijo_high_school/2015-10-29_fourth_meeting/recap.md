## What Went Well

Everyone was able to access the workshop (get past slow computers) and work on
the first few steps without being generally confused.

## Issues

Collecting feedback didn't really occur as meeting ended earlier than planned.

## Tips For Other Organizers

Create a personal relationship with members and build a community. Try to walk
through the workshop step by step with people.
